### About me
Hello! I'm Juan Esp√≠ritu, systems engineer and business administrator. During my career, I discovered the power of IT solutions to control business objectives, which led me to study systems engineering and delve into the world of data. Through Henry's Bootcamp, I acquired skills to identify and develop measurement indicators, as well as to efficiently acquire information using IT solutions.

Although I do not have work experience directly related to my studies, I developed management and teamwork skills through various extracurricular activities, such as the creation of a board game club and participation in leadership and student reinforcement programs during my university days. These experiences have allowed me to acquire a broader approach at the organizational level.

Currently, I am looking for job opportunities that will allow me to continue developing my skills in this exciting field. If you are looking for someone with skills in data analysis, indicator measurement and teamwork, do not hesitate to contact me! I would love to learn about your projects and contribute my knowledge to achieve the proposed objectives.
